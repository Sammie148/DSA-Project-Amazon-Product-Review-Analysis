# DSA-Project-Documentation

This is where i documented my first project work after my Lessons with the Incubator Hub.
It was a challanging and beautiful moment that i could not help but enjoy the journey as it went, thrilling moments.

## DSA Project Capstone-Amazon Product Review Analysis

### ProjectOverview
This Project was aimed at analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement.

### Data Sources
The data that was used here was given to us by the DSA community, it was gotten from our individual LMS program which was designed for personal interface for anyone who registered with the program.

### Tools Used
- Ms Excel
   - Excel was used for data cleaning, data collection, and manipulation. 
   - Excel was also used to organise the data using pivot tables.
   - It was used to create a dashboard, and charts.
    
### Data Cleaning and Preparation 
Before analysing, i did:
1. Data Loading and inspection.
2. Replacing wrongly placed variables.
3. Resolved missing variables.
4. Data Cleaning and Formatting.
5. Created several calculated columns which included price range bucket, total potential revenue.
6. recalculated the discount percentage column to revalidate it.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploring the data helped us solve some issues which included:
 - Products with highests average rating
 - Average discount rate
 - Top Products by rating count
 - Products with highest discount
 - Products with the Highest Revenue Income
   
### Data Analysis
Some of the lines of code/tools used involved:
- COUNTIF function in Excel was used to count the number of products with discount of 50% and above
- Summarizations by Average
- Conditional function (Like the IF function) was used to create a price bucket range
- Bar charts
- Pie chart

### Insight Gathered
 1. From my Analysis, i discovered that the Product categories woth higest sales and highest revenue were Electronics of all sorts, particularly the Mobile accessories like phones, charger's and powerbanks.
 2. The second Categories were Computer accessories
 3. And based on this findings, my recommendation would be hat we invest more in Electronics, a little more in Computer Accessories, and less in other categories.
